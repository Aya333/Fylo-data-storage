  .inner-part {
    width: 10vw;
    height: 10vw;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 50%;
    left: 65%;
    background-color: hsl(243, 100%, 93%);
    clip-path: polygon(
      0 23%,
      100% 24%,
      100% 67%,
      100% 63%,
      100% 83%,
      85% 66%,
      0 65%
    );
    border: 2px solid hsl(229, 57%, 11%);
